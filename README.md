# 🎓 EduChampion Framework
An AI-powered Educational Analytics Dashboard for student performance prediction, explainability, and sustainability tracking.

## 🚀 About
EduChampion is a modular, agent-based system that predicts student performance using ML models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM) trained on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD).

It includes:
- Agent 1: Data Ingestion  
- Agent 2: Performance Prediction  
- Agent 3: Pattern Discovery (LSTM)  
- Agent 4: Explainability (LIME)  
- Agent 5: Sustainability Tracking (CO₂ emissions)  
- Agent 6: Visualization  
- Agent 7: Prediction Interface (Interactive Dashboard)

## 🧩 Features
✅ Predict student outcomes  
✅ Visualize model accuracy and loss curves  
✅ Explain predictions via LIME  
✅ Track carbon footprint of training  
✅ Upload CSVs for batch predictions
